Project title: Web Board Game

My Qualifications and strengths:
I have experience using html, php, and sql in previous projects. 

Problem statement:
People are bored and they want a fun online board game to play.

Goal: 
	Create an online board game inspired by Board Game Online

Online Board Game using HTML with PHP as a backend 

The user can use a guest account or create an account that saves the results from previous games and friends list

User can …
-	Sign in or use a guest account
-	Create a game
-	Invite friends in app or send an invite link
-	Play the game
-	Roll the dice to move forward
-	Whoever reaches the end wins
If I have time to implement:
-	Players can get coins after their turn
-	Use coins to buy items
-	Could have an actual game board with different paths instead of a straight line
-	I want the game to support at least 4 players

Needs some kind of polling or pushing to update the game state

Data I need to store:
-	Usernames 
-	Hashed Passwords
-	Active game links
-	The users in each game including registered users and guest accounts
-	Player position on the board
-	Each player’s inventory of items
-	Each player’s number of coins
-	The results of each game including who won
